    <h5>DANCING</h5>

    <p>Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.</p>
<p>Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. </p>

    <h5>SINGING</h5>

    <p>Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists</p>
<p> I love to sing because it activates my imagination. I envision layers of textures and colours when I hear vocal tones coming from my voice and the voice of others. I love to sing because it makes me feel as though I am part of something bigger than myself. </p>

    <h5>TEACHING</h5>

    <p>A teacher, also called a schoolteacher or formally an educator, is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence or virtue. Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone.</p>
<p>Teachers provide the power of education to today's youth, thereby giving them the possibility for a better future. Teachers simplify the complex, and make abstract concepts accessible to students. Teachers also expose children to ideas and topics that they might otherwise not have come into contact with.</p>
